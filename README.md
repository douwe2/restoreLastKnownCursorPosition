# restoreLastKnownCursorPosition README

While editing it keeps track of the lastest cursor position in your document. When you later open the document that cursor position will
be restored.
This primarly meant if you use code as a single document editor (ie notepad or nedit)
When you press a mouse button in a code texteditor window the edito cursor is set to where you the mouse pointer was, in that case
press ctrl+al+c to restore the cursor position to the cursor position the cursor was at when the document was previously opened.


**Enjoy!**
